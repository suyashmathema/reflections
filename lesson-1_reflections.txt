How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    i could see the differences line by line if it varied 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If i program some bugs in the software i can go back to my previous version
and work on it again or i can compare it with the old file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manually commiting will help when you want to have different version and
adding new features without touching the old ones but you need to keep track of
the files if done manually.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To allow for a backup.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    use git log to get the details of the commit including the id of the commit
and then use the id of commit in git diff command to compare the files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    i can go back to any pervious commit so that i can pin point where the new
bug started to come up and then work in the code which was added after that 
commit

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    to make my new application
